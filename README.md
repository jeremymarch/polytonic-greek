### polytonic-greek
Low-level polytonic Greek unicode helper functions.  

By default it uses the unicode-normalization crate.  Turn off default features to 
use built in functions and reduce binary size: e.g.  

polytonic-greek = { git = "https://github.com/jeremymarch/polytonic-greek", default-features = false, version = "0.4.6" }
